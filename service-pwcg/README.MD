# PWCG Service

The PWCG service allows routes of missions generated by the PWCG to be retrieved on demand to be
displayed by third party applications.

This service is only available if the PWCG directory (named "PWCGCampaign") is found in the root of
the game's directory.

The coordinates of each route point is defined in game world units. The X component increases
horizontally from west to east and the Y component increases vertically from south to north.
