# IL-2 Integrator CLI
The CLI provides an interface (not a standard integrator interface) for easier testing during
development and is not intended to be released to the public.
When running, the CLI has no registered interfaces by default. They can, however, be added during
development for testing purposes.

## Using the tool
Commands are typed into the command line using the following format:

`<service> <command> [arg=val1 arg2=val2]`

To close the integrator you can type `exit`.
